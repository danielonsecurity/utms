# UTS - Python Package

This repository contains the UTS Python package. Follow the steps below to clone the repository, install Poetry, and run the package.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

## Steps to Get Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielonsecurity/uts.git
cd uts
```

### 2. Install Poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is a Python dependency management tool that simplifies the process of managing dependencies and packaging.

Either install Poetry from your package manager, or follow the official installation method:

#### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

#### On Windows:

For Windows, use the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicP) | python -
```

After installation, make sure Poetry is available in your systemâ€™s `PATH` by running:

```bash
poetry --version
```

### 3. Install Project Dependencies

Now, install the project dependencies using Poetry. In the project directory, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `pyproject.toml` file.

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment

Poetry automatically creates a virtual environment for your project. To activate it, run:

```bash
poetry shell
```

This will activate the environment where you can run the package and its dependencies.

### Setting up Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Create an Gemini API key here https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey and add it to `.env`.


### 5. Run the Python Package

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can run the package using the following command:

```bash
poetry run python -m uts
```

OR just simply run it like this:

```bash
uts
```


This will execute the package. If you have specific commands or functionality to run, you can adjust the command accordingly.
