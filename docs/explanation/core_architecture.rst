Core Architecture
=================

UTMS is designed around several core modules, each responsible for a different aspect of time management. Below is an overview of the most important components:

- **Clock**: The `clock.py` module is the heart of UTMS, providing timekeeping logic and synchronization.
- **Configuration**: The `config.py` file manages settings, including NTP synchronization, time units, and other global settings.
- **Anchors**: The `anchors.py` module defines how to create, manage, and manipulate time anchors. Anchors are key reference points that allow users to calculate differences between events.
- **Units**: The `units.py` module defines various time units and their conversions, ensuring that users can work seamlessly across different scales.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: The `cli.py` module enables users to interact with UTMS via commands like `utms config`, `utms ntp`, and `utms anchor`.

Modular Design
--------------
The modular design of UTMS allows flexibility and ease of extension. Developers can modify or replace individual components of the system (e.g., add new units of time or implement a custom time synchronization strategy) without disrupting the rest of the system.

Interoperability
----------------
UTMS integrates with external timekeeping systems like NTP (Network Time Protocol) for synchronization. Additionally, it can be extended to support other systems (e.g., GPS-based time sources) through custom modules.

The system is built to operate independently of external services, although these integrations are supported to enhance reliability and precision.
